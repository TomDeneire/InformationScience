    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter we went from searching to indexing rather quickly. In fact, although we acknowledged that searching is a discrete field of computer science, we limited our practical discussion of it to an example of the .find() string method in Python! \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we have already seen that searching text is rarely as easy as that. Searching vast data sets lead us to indexing, as did the issue of complex searches, such as Boolean queries. Moreover, not all searching tasks can be solved with indexing. Sometimes we want to include wildcards (you are probably familiar with the `*` and `?` symbols) and will need to use **regular expressions** in our search, while other times we are not looking for exact results, but more interested in **fuzzy searching**.

    "\n",
    "The `*` symbol we used is actually part of a separate programming language, called **regular expressions**. [Wikipedia:Regular_expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) says:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp; also referred to as rational expression) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for \"find\" or \"find and replace\" operations on strings, or for input validation. It is a technique developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The concept arose in the 1950s when the American mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene formalized the description of a regular language. The concept came into common use with Unix text-processing utilities. Different syntaxes for writing regular expressions have existed since the 1980s, one being the POSIX standard and another, widely used, being the Perl syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Regular expressions are used in search engines, search and replace dialogs of word processors and text editors, in text processing utilities such as sed and AWK and in lexical analysis. Many programming languages provide regex capabilities either built-in or via libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses the Perl regex syntax, as do, for instance, Java, JavaScript, Julia, Ruby, Microsoft's .NET Framework, and others. Some environments actually let you choose the regex syntax you want to use, like PHP or the UNIX `grep` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are an extremely powerful tool, but as the above cartoon shows there is a downside too. It is sometimes said that regular expressions are a *write only* programming language, as the code is often hardly readable, especially if you revisit a regex written long ago. Moreover, regular expresssions can be very tricky, for example, when they provide exact matches in your tests, only to produce mismatches when you open up the use cases. \n",

[Wikipedia:Approximate_string_matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching) explains:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> > transposition: co**st** → co**ts**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Different approximate matchers impose different constraints. Some matchers use a single global unweighted cost, that is, the total number of primitive operations necessary to convert the match to the pattern. For example, if the pattern is coil, foil differs by one substitution, coils by one insertion, oil by one deletion, and foal by two substitutions. If all operations count as a single unit of cost and the limit is set to one, foil, coils, and oil will count as matches while foal will not.\n",
    "\n",

    "A [string metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_metric) (also known as a string similarity metric or string distance function) is a metric that measures distance (\"inverse similarity\") between two text strings. A string metric provides a number indicating an algorithm-specific indication of distance. The most widely known string metric is a rudimentary one called the [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) (also known as \"edit distance\"). \n",

The lower the Jaro-Winkler distance for two strings is, the more similar the strings are. The score is normalized such that 1 means an exact match and 0 means there is no similarity. For a Python implementation of the Jaro-Winkler similarity, which is a modified version of the Jaro-Winkler distance, giving more favorable ratings to strings that match from the beginning, see the [course repository](https://github.com/TomDeneire/InformationScience/blob/main/course/jarowinkler.py).\n",

This articulates the difference between database querying, with results in *data*, and information retrieval querying, which results in *documents* containing data. In order to sift through the search results of the latter, we need [evaluation measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_measures_(information_retrieval)) and [ranking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking_(information_retrieval)) to make the results usable.
