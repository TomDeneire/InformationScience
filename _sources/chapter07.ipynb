    "In all of our discussions about information we have so far neglected perhaps the most important aspect of it: **searching**. Indeed, you could say that the only difference between data and information, is that \"information is data that we are looking for\". Ergo, very simply said, working with information often boils down to \"searching stuff\". Whether it be metadata stored in databases (e.g. searching a library catalogue), text stored in documents (e.g. a full-text search-engine for a website) or even multimedia information retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching and search optimization are a vast area of computer science and a distinct type of computational problem. For instance, Donald Knuth's monumental *The Art of Computer Programming* devotes an entire volume (i.e. vol. 3) to \"Sorting and Searching\". This means that we will only be able to briefly touch on the topic and, as always, from a very practical point of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, at face value searching might seem **simple**. Let's look at finding a substring in a string. In Python, for instance, offers several ways to check for this:"

    "One of these is [Whoosh](https://whoosh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), which is unfortunately no longer maintained. Still, the most recent version, 2.7.4, is quite stable and still works fine for Python 3. It can easily be installed through `pip install Whoosh`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [Whoosh introduction](https://whoosh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html) we read:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **About Whoosh**\n",
    ">- Whoosh is fast, but uses only pure Python, so it will run anywhere Python runs, without requiring a compiler.\n",
    ">- Whoosh creates fairly small indexes compared to many other search libraries.\n",
    ">- All indexed text in Whoosh must be unicode.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What is Woosh**\n",
    "\n",
    ">Whoosh is a fast, pure Python search engine library.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The primary design impetus of Whoosh is that it is pure Python. You should be able to use Whoosh anywhere you can use Python, no compiler or Java required.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Like one of its ancestors, Lucene, Whoosh is not really a search engine, it’s a programmer library for creating a search engine.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Practically no important behavior of Whoosh is hard-coded. Indexing of text, the level of information stored for each term in each field, parsing of search queries, the types of queries allowed, scoring algorithms, etc. are all customizable, replaceable, and extensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, Whoosh is quite similar to Lucene, including its query language. It lets you connect terms with `AND` or `OR`, eliminate terms with `NOT`, group terms together into clauses with parentheses, do range, prefix, and wilcard queries, and specify different fields to search. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following code shows you how to create and search a basic Whoosh index. For more information, see the [Whoosh quick start](https://whoosh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html) and documentation on the [query language](https://whoosh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/querylang.html).\n"
