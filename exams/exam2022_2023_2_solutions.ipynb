    "\n",
    "In her book \"Foundations of Information\", Amy Ko discusses both sides of the argument that computers are the \"best\" information technology. Describe two upsides and two downsides of the computer relative to other information technologies (e.g. printing press, photography, ...)."

    "### Answer 1-1\n",
    "\n",
    "Ko discusses the fact that computers have had a drastic impact on the way we receive information. Computers have changed the way we interact with information as well, an advantage of this latest information technology is for instance the speed and accuracy in which computers can be used. If we have a question, with computers this can be answered in minutes and with great accuracy. The abundance of information available through computers is also very different to previous information technologies, computers have the capability to store, process and retrieve data faster than anything we have ever created. Through computers the access to basically unlimited databases and other sources of information is unlike anything we have ever seen. The computer is so fast, accurate and complete that it has changed the way we view information technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also drawbacks to this, one Ko mentions is the amplification of information. As the world is so connected, news spreads very fast but so does misinformation or disinformation and computers tend to amplify this way more than any prior information technology. Amplification causes big issues such as hate speech or harassment, with the power to destroy lives. Another negative Ko mentions is centralization of information, where big wealthy companies like Google and Facebook have become the main source of information for many people. It is easy this way but if you are unhappy with these services, there are few alternatives left. The days of many different news sources with each their specific values and ethics are no longer, they had to adapt or were left behind. \n",
    "\n",
    "What Ko stresses here is that the ease in finding information nowadays is not only positive, there are plenty of people that have been wronged by the immense power that computers as an information technology have and it is important that these issues are not overlooked."

    "### Question 1-2\n",
    "\n",
    "Have a look at the ICONCLASS website: [https://iconclass.org/](https://iconclass.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of information science, what is ICONCLASS and give an example of how you could use it in an information system."

    "### Answer 1-2\n",
    "\n",
    "ICONCLASS is a specialized classification system in the content of images. It is primarily used in the fields of art history and cultural studies. It is a meticulously organized system for categorizing and labeling visual content found in artworks, such as paintings, sculptures, and other creative expressions. This system is important for structuring and accessing information related to art and culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use ICONCLASS as information system, I would explain with the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're in charge of creating an extensive digital archive for an art museum's collection. This digital archive will be accessible online, and you want visitors to easily find and explore artworks based on their themes or subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make precise Categories: For each artwork in the museum's collection, you would assign specific ICONCLASS codes that describe the content, themes, or subjects depicted in the artwork. For instance, a painting depicting a historical battle could be assigned an ICONCLASS code related to \"historical events\" and \"battles.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Better Search Functionality: With these ICONCLASS codes in place, you can create a search function within your digital archive. Visitors to the museum's website can now search for artworks not only by artist or title but also by themes or subjects. For example, a user interested in seeing all artworks related to \"mythology\" can simply enter that term, and the system will retrieve all relevant artworks based on their ICONCLASS codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Link Data: as Linked Open Data, ICONCLASS is deal in an information system because of its interoperability. In this way, it can then be easily combined with other databases and other sources of information. If the user is not satisfied with the metadata provided on the website itself, the information system using ICONCLASS can easily link to other resources like DBpedia or Wikidata to provide additional information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data Analysis: Over time, you can analyze the data gathered from ICONCLASS codes. You might discover trends, like which themes are most popular among artists or how the portrayal of certain subjects has evolved over time. This data-driven approach can inform curatorial decisions and research in art history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, ICONCLASS serves as a valuable tool for structuring and organizing information, making it more accessible and meaningful to users."
