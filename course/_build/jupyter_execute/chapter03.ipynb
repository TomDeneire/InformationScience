It is *always already* manipulated in order to present it in a certain way (Derrida pun intended). So we could say that at the heart of information retrieval is **manipulating information**, i.e. selecting, grouping, filtering, ordering, sorting, ranking. (For those of you who know __[SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)__, notice how this resembles the syntax of a `select` statement? For those of you who don't, don't worry, we'll look into it later on.)\n",
