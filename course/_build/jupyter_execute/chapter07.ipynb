    "In the previous chapter we went from searching to indexing rather quickly. In fact, although we acknowledged that searching is a discrete field of computer science, we limited our practical discussion of it to an example of *string*.find(*substring*) in Python! Evidently, there is more to searching than just this. Moreover, we also need to say something about the crucial follow-up of any searching operation, i.e. the evaluation and subsequent ranking of the search results. Indeed, the very basic Information Retrieval model is:\n",

    "> Retrieval > Searching > Evaluation > Ranking\n",

    "Having already discussed some of the aspects of retrieval (e.g. querying), in this chapter, we will try to discuss the other factors. Again, we will do so from a very practical and hands-on standpoint, neglecting more or less completely the theoretical or multimedia dimension of these issues (see chapters 4-5, 14 in *Modern Information Retrieval*). Indeed, we will focus on text exclusively here."

    "We have already seen that searching text is rarely as easy as `string.find(substring)`. Searching vast data sets lead us to indexing, as did the issue of complex searches, such as Boolean queries. However, not all of the complex searches can be solved with indexing. Sometimes we want to include wildcards (many people are familiar with the `*` symbol) in our search, while other times we are not looking for exact results, but more interested in *fuzzy* searching."

    "The `*` symbol we used is actually part of a separate programming language, called **regular expressions**. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) says:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp; also referred to as rational expression) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for \"find\" or \"find and replace\" operations on strings, or for input validation. It is a technique developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The concept arose in the 1950s when the American mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene formalized the description of a regular language. The concept came into common use with Unix text-processing utilities. Different syntaxes for writing regular expressions have existed since the 1980s, one being the POSIX standard and another, widely used, being the Perl syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Regular expressions are used in search engines, search and replace dialogs of word processors and text editors, in text processing utilities such as sed and AWK and in lexical analysis. Many programming languages provide regex capabilities either built-in or via libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses the Perl regex syntax, as do, for instance, Java, JavaScript, Julia, Ruby, Microsoft's .NET Framework, and others. Some environments actually let you choose the regex syntax you want to use, like PHP or the UNIX `grep` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are an extremely powerful tool, but as the above cartoon shows there is a downside too. It is sometimes said that regular expressions are a *write only* programming language, as the code is often hardly readable, especially if you revisit a regex written long ago. Moreover, regular expresssions can be very tricky, for example, when they provide exact matches in your tests, only to produce mismatches when you open up the use cases. \n",

    "\n",
    "> The closeness of a match is measured in terms of the number of primitive operations necessary to convert the string into an exact match. This number is called the edit distance between the string and the pattern. The usual primitive operations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "> > insertion: cot → co**a**t\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> > deletion: co**a**t → co\\*t\n",
    "\n",
    "> > substitution: co**a**t → co**s**t\n",
    "\n",
    "> Some approximate matchers also treat transposition, in which the positions of two letters in the string are swapped, to be a primitive operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> > transposition: co**st** → co**ts**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Different approximate matchers impose different constraints. Some matchers use a single global unweighted cost, that is, the total number of primitive operations necessary to convert the match to the pattern. For example, if the pattern is coil, foil differs by one substitution, coils by one insertion, oil by one deletion, and foal by two substitutions. If all operations count as a single unit of cost and the limit is set to one, foil, coils, and oil will count as matches while foal will not.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Other matchers specify the number of operations of each type separately, while still others set a total cost but allow different weights to be assigned to different operations. Some matchers permit separate assignments of limits and weights to individual groups in the pattern.\n",

A string metric provides a number indicating an algorithm-specific indication of distance. The most widely known string metric is a rudimentary one called the __[Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance)__ (also known as edit distance).

Nowadays, with the advent of big data and the ubiquity of information, the best search engines make the difference not by the amount of information they yield, but by the ranking of the results they display.
