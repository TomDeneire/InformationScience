In this chapter, we are going to do the same with information itself. Indeed, a lot of what happens in information science does not have to do with information *per se*, but with information *about* information, also known as **metadata**:\n",

    "Now let's compare this to the title page.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For instance, we see that the difference in **case**, i.e. lower case, upper case and small caps, has disappeared. This might seem trivial, but did you realise that in Renaissance Latin a capitalized final \"I\" stands for \"ii\"? So the full title is actually, \"Ivsti Lipsii...\" Or, suppose that someone is studying the use of capitalization in title layout as a marketing means. This is vital information that is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Moreover, when we focus on the **title words**, we see small differences. Whereas the title page does not have a space between \"Tormentis.Telis\", the transcription does. And it also leaves out the italic parts *Ad Historiarum lucem* (In light of History) and *Cum Privilegiis Caesareo & Regio* (With Imperial and Royal Privilege). Again, such information could be very interesting to book historians, including the fact that italic type is used on the front page (again a matter of layout which could be construed as visual marketing).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Also, when we look at the **date**, we notice this has been interpreted rather than transcribed. The Roman numeral (with the typical dots) has been silently turned into '1596'. This does injustice to the fact that humanists like Lipsius used Roman numerals on their title pages as a conscious imitation of ancient Roman epigraphy. The same goes for the line breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Furthermore, we see that **copy specific** information, such as the stamp in the upper right corner and the pasted on inscription on the bottom have also been left out. \n",
    "\n",
    "- On the other hand, there is also **more information** in the descriptive metadata than is on the title page. The names of the illustrators, for instance, and the name of Christopher Plantin's widow are added. In other words, the descriptive metadata covers a wide region of information about an object, possibly even information that is not explicity present in the object itself."

    "These difference between a book object and various sources of descriptive metadata can be explained from the use of different **cataloguing rules**. Indeed, it is impossible to simply catalogue at book title (or indeed any item, be it physical or digital) \"as is\". However diplomatic and inclusive you try to be when cataloguing, you will always have to make hard decisions about how to handle layout, how to transcribe characters, whether or not to standardize spelling, punctuation, etcetera. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of this is perfectly understandable and in general (good) catalogues will be explicit and very scrupulous in the cataloguing rules they follow. The danger is that when we leave the cataloguing context and, for instance, acquire catalogue information in a data dump (STCV is freely available [here](https://www.uantwerpen.be/nl/projecten/anet/open-data/)) we tend to forget this and take the **metadata at face value**.\n",

Remember, in those days, most people would go up to the \"P\" section and browse for \"Prince\"!\n",

It should be a Python application that asks for a LOI number (e.g. `c:lvd:123456`), uses OAI to harvest the MARC21 metadata and then writes the Dublin Core conversion to a file (e.g. `123456.xml`).\n",
