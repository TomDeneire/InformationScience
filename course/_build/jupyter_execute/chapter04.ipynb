    "## Information (retrieval) models vs database models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Information models\n",
    "\n",
    "Formal discussions of information might start with the discussion of **information models**. [Wikipedia's definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_model) reads:\n",
    "\n",
    "> An information model in software engineering is a representation of concepts and the relationships, constraints, rules, and operations to specify [data semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_data_model) for a chosen domain of discourse. Typically it specifies relations between kinds of things, but may also include relations with individual things. It can provide sharable, stable, and organized structure of information requirements or knowledge for the domain context.\n",
    "\n",
    "> An information model provides formalism to the description of a problem domain without constraining how that description is mapped to an actual implementation in software. There may be many mappings of the information model. Such mappings are called data models (...)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Information retrieval models\n",
    "\n",
    "Information retrieval then goes a step further and also provides theoretical models for retrieving information, as, for instance, we read in [Modern Information Retrieval](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780321416919):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Modeling in IR is a complex process aimed at producing a ranking function, i.e., a function that assigns scores to documents with regard to a given query. This process consists of two main tasks: (a) the conception of a logical framework for representing documents and queries and (b) the definition of a ranking function that computes a rank for each document with regard to a given query.\n",
    "\n",
    "> To build a model, we think first of representations of the documents and of the user information needs. In the case of a document, the representation might be a subset of all terms in the document, which can be generated by removing stopwords (such as articles and prepositions) from the text, for instance. In the case of a query the representation might be a superset of the query terms formed by the original query enriched with synonyms, for instance. Given these representations, we then concieve the framework in which they can be modeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database models\n",
    "\n",
    "However, while such models are obviously very interesting for information science, the discussion is also highly theoretical and requires no small amount of mathematics (set theory, algebra, probability theory, ...). \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, from our practical perspective it makes more sense to open up the discussion of information, by dealing with **database models**. Indeed, in most real-world applications of information science, you will most likely have to deal with specific databases that store information and not with the abstract information models that map the data to these databases. \n"

    "## Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) defines a database as a \"an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system\". Such a broad definition allows for many different kinds of databases, ranging from a single line of text (e.g. `apples,oranges,grapes` is a database!) to complex database management systems (DBMS) that operate on large data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classification of databases is a topic for a course on its own. For now, it will suffice to say that the development of database technology can be divided into three eras based on data model or structure: \n",

    "### Navigational\n",
    "\n",
    "[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigational_database) says\n",
    "\n",
    ">A navigational database is a type of database in which records or objects are found primarily by following **references from other objects**. The term was popularized by the title of Charles Bachman's 1973 Turing Award paper, The Programmer as Navigator. This paper emphasized the fact that the new disk-based database systems allowed the programmer to choose arbitrary navigational routes following relationships from record to record, contrasting this with the constraints of earlier magnetic-tape and punched card systems where data access was strictly sequential.\n",
    "\n",
    "(...)\n",
    "\n",
    ">Although Bachman described the concept of navigation in abstract terms, the idea of navigational access came to be associated strongly with the procedural design of the CODASYL Data Manipulation Language. Writing in 1982, for example, Tsichritzis and Lochovsky state that \"The notion of currency is central to the concept of navigation.\" By the **notion of currency**, they refer to the idea that a program maintains (explicitly or implicitly) a current position in any sequence of records that it is processing, and that operations such as `GET NEXT` and `GET PRIOR` retrieve records relative to this current position, while also changing the current position to the record that is retrieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underpinning the navigational model is the idea of **data as a table**.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the basic formats of tabular data is CSV, which is easy to work with in Python, through the built-in library `csv` or with `pandas`."

    "\n",
    "[Wikipedia:Relational_model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model) and [Wikipedia:Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) say:\n",
    "\n",
    ">The relational model (...) is an approach to managing data using a structure and language consistent with first-order predicate logic, first described in 1969 by English computer scientist Edgar F. Codd, where all **data is represented in terms of tuples, grouped into relations**. (...) he described a new system for storing and working with large databases. Instead of records being stored in some sort of linked list of free-form records (...), Codd's idea was to organise the **data as a number of \"tables\"**, each table being used for a different type of entity. Each table would contain a fixed number of columns containing the attributes of the entity. One or more columns of each table were designated as a primary key by which the rows of the table could be uniquely identified; cross-references between tables always used these primary keys, rather than disk addresses, and queries would join tables based on these key relationships, using a set of operations based on the mathematical system of relational calculus (from which the model takes its name). Splitting the data into a set of normalized tables (or relations) aimed to ensure that each \"fact\" was only stored once, thus simplifying update operations. Virtual tables called views could present the data in different ways for different users, but views could not be directly updated.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The purpose of the relational model is to provide a **declarative method** for specifying data and queries: users directly state what information the database contains and what information they want from it, and let the database management system software take care of describing data structures for storing the data and retrieval procedures for answering queries.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Most relational databases use the **SQL** data definition and query language.\n",
    "\n",

Such databases have existed since the late 1960s, but the name \"NoSQL\" was only coined in the early 21st century (...) NoSQL databases are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications. NoSQL systems are also sometimes called **\"not only SQL\"** to emphasize that they may support SQL-like query languages or sit alongside SQL databases (...).\n",
    "\n",
    ">The data structures used by NoSQL databases (e.g. key–value pair, wide column, graph, or document) are different from those used by default in relational databases, making some operations faster in NoSQL. The particular suitability of a given NoSQL database depends on the problem it must solve. Sometimes the data structures used by NoSQL databases are also viewed as **more flexible** than relational database tables.\n",

    "#### RDF\n",
    "\n",
    "to do: make this more explicit and introduce .nt type for triples (much easier than xml!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we do not have time to discuss RDF and Linked Data in detail. However, it is important to realize that RDF is a **data model, not a data serialization model**, such as XML or JSON - in fact, both can be used to express RDF data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick summary from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework):\n",
    "\n",
    ">The RDF data model is similar to classical conceptual modeling approaches (such as entity–relationship or class diagrams). It is based on the idea of making statements about resources (in particular web resources) in expressions of the form **subject–predicate–object, known as triples**. The subject denotes the resource, and the predicate denotes traits or aspects of the resource, and expresses a relationship between the subject and the object.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">For example, one way to represent the notion \"The sky has the color blue\" in RDF is as the triple: a **subject** denoting \"the sky\", a **predicate** denoting \"has the color\", and an **object** denoting \"blue\". \n",
    ">\n",
    ">RDF is an abstract model with several serialization formats (i.e. file formats), so the particular encoding for resources or triples varies from format to format.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to define the data used in RDF we use a **Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)**, a unique and unambiguous identifier for all things described in the triplestore. To illustrate how this works, let's look at the part of the RDF/XML for the Wikidata entry [Paris](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q90), known as entity `Q90`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n",
    "    <rdf:Description rdf:about=\"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q90\">\n",
    "        <wdt:P1376 rdf:resource=\"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q142\"/>\n",
    "    </rdf:Description>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a triple expressing the fact that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"Paris\" (subject) \n",
    "2. \"is the capital of\" (predicate) \n",
    "3. \"France\" (object)\n",
    "\n",
    "To express this three URIs are used: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Q90` (Paris)\n",
    "2. `P1376` (property \"is capital of\") \n",
    "3. `Q142` (France)\n",
    "\n",
    "Theismakes the statement unique, uniform, unambiguous (telling a computer that Paris the city, not Paris Hilton (Q47899) is the capital of France), and also **Linked Data**: all elements of the triple are linked up to other data, e.g. `Q142` which was the object in this statement, will be the subject of others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the difference with non-RDF XML where resources are not identified with URIs and data is not linked and the model not open:\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n",
    "    <Description>Paris\n",
    "        <isCapitalof>France</isCapitalof>\n",
    "    </Description>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "RDF and especially Linked Open Data are undoubtedly part of the future for information science. If you're interested to know more or need to work with RDF and Linked Data in practice, I highly recommend reading *A Librarian's Guide to Graphs, Data and the Semantic Web*, By James Powell, [ISBN 978-1843347538](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781843347538)."
