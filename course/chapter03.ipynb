Even when we thing we are merely making it accessable through catalogs or search engines, information is, as postmodern philosopher [Jacques Derrida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Derrida) would say, *always already* manipulated. \n",

    "So we could say that at the heart of information retrieval is **manipulating information**, i.e. selecting, grouping, filtering, ordering, sorting, ranking. In fact, `select`, `group`, `filter`, `order`, `sort` and `rank` are the most important keywords in the world's most used database query language, [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), which we will talk about later.\n",

However, since 8-bit bytes only give you 256 possibilities, today multibyte encodings are used. In the past, different areas of the world used different encodings, which was software's Tower of Babel, causing a bunch of communication problems to this day. Luckily, today [UTF8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)is more or less the international standard --- for instance, accounting for 97% of all web pages. UTF-8 is capable of encoding all 1,112,064 valid character [code points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point) in [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) using one to four one-byte units."
