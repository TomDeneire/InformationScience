    "In the previous chapter I consciously steered the discussion away from information models to data models. Whereas Information Retrieval specifically deals with retrieving information (documents, multimedia, ...), Information Science focusses more on data or, better said, **metadata**.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) says:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Metadata is \"data that provides information about other data\". In other words, it is \"data about data.\" Many distinct types of metadata exist, including descriptive metadata, structural metadata, (...)\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive metadata, for instance, is descriptive information about a resource. It is used for discovery and identification. If we think about books, for example, descriptive metadata would include elements such as title, author, date of publication, etcetera. Or, Exif (Exchangeable image file format) is a metadata standard that specifies the formats for images, sound, and ancillary tags used by digital cameras (including smartphones), scanners and other systems handling image and sound files recorded by digital cameras."

    "\n",
    "- For instance, we see that the difference between lower case, upper case and small caps has disappeared. This might seem trivial, but did you realise that in Renaissance Latin a capitalized final \"I\" stands for \"ii\"? So the full title is actually, \"Ivsti Lipsii...\" Or, suppose that someone is studying the use of capitalization in title layout as a marketing means. This is vital information that is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Moreover, when we focus on the title, we see small changes. Whereas the title page does not have a space between \"Tormentis.Telis\", the transcription does. And it also leaves out the italic parts (another piece of layout info missing!) \"Ad Historiarum lucem\" (In light of History) and \"Cum Privilegiis Caesareo & Regio\" (With Imperial and Royal Privilege). Again, such information could be very interesting to book historians.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Also, when we look at the date, we notice this has been interpreted rather than transcribed. The Roman numeral (with the typical dots) has been silently turned into '1596'.\n",

    "- Furthermore, we see that copy specific information, such as the stamp in the upper right corner and the pasted on inscription on the bottom have also been left out. \n",
    "\n",

    "This example shows that different catalogues adhere to different cataloguing rules. It is impossible to simply catalogue at book title (or indeed any item, be it physical or digital) \"as is\". However diplomatic and inclusive you try to be when cataloguing, you will always have to make hard decisions about how to handle layout, how to transcribe characters, whether or not to standardize spelling, punctuation, etcetera. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of this is perfectly understandable and in general (good) catalogues will be explicit and very scrupulous in the cataloguing rules they follow. The danger is that when we leave the cataloguing context and, for instance, acquire catalogue information in a data dump (STCV is freely available [here](https://www.uantwerpen.be/nl/projecten/anet/open-data/)) we tend to forget this and take the metadata at face value.\n",

And what happens when, as good DH research is bound to do, you break open metadata containers and aggregate metadata, for instance merging several of the national \"short-title catalogue\" initiatives (STCV, STCN, ESTC, USTC, ...), which all adhere to different rules?\n",

Remember, in those days, most people would go up to the \"P\" section and browse for \"Prince\"!\n",

    "\n",

So when setting up an OAI server, one of the main tasks is coding software that converts data from one standard to another. Libraries management systems, for instance, need such conversions both to be able to feed an OAI server from their own database respository, or, vice versa, to harvest data from external repositories and convert it to the standard(s) they use.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the standards specifications, all implementations of OAI-PMH must support representing metadata in Dublin Core, so your assignment will be to write a metadata converter that is able to harvest MARC21 metadata (XML) and convert that to Dublin Core (XML). It should be a Python command line application that asks for a LOI number (e.g. `c:lvd:123456`), uses OAI to harvest the MARC21 metadata and then writes the Dublin Core conversion to a file (e.g. `123456.xml`).\n",

You can limit yourself to the fields mentioned in the \"unqualified\" table and skip the \"Leader\" field. You will find the meaning of the various codes (`a`, `c`, etcetera) in the MARC specification, but you can limit yourself to code `a`, unless the crosswalk explicitly mentions other codes (e.g. `260` = `Publisher`)\n",
